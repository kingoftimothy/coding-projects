This is Currency Converter Project Details! <br> <br>
This project uses python to develop a simple GUI application to build a currency converter that allows you to convert currencies from one unit to another, such as converting US Dollars into pounds or euros.
<br><br>
The design of this application focuses on the primary function, which is converting currency units and uses the Tkinter API to access the Tk GUI toolkit, which comes with Python.
<br><br>
The Real-time Exchange rates are also accessed by the use of this API [https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/python-currency-api) to get real-time exchange rates. This python app project also imports required Libraries regarding Tkinter and requests libraries. 
<br><br>
The Converter App also uses the Standard Currency Codes and provides a table for the user to see and enter it. When entering the Currency Codes, the application will automatically output the symbol of the currency for that specific transaction.
